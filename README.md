# README

Welcome! This repository currently includes a simple placeholder README.

Why this exists:
- The project owner requested a lightweight README that "can say whatever." This file is here to satisfy that request and to give you a friendly place to start documenting the project.

Suggested next steps:
- Describe what the project does and who it is for.
- List prerequisites and how to set up the development environment.
- Document how to run, test, and build the project.
- Note any deployment steps, environment variables, or CI/CD details.

Tips for a great README:
- Keep the top section short and outcome‑oriented.
- Add a quickstart with copy‑paste commands.
- Include links to architecture docs or specs if available.

Have fun and make it your own!
